WHERE TO START A NEW GYM BUSINESS IN THE CITY OF TORONTO

## BUSINESS PROBLEM-INTRODUCTION
The city of Toronto is the most populated city in Canada and one of the most populated cities in North America.
As it is a very developed city, so is the business case. That's why any new investment or 
company that wants to move to Toronto needs to use market-based insights that will help them 
understand the business environment, allowing for a strategy to reduce risk. And increase the return on investment.

## DATA SECTION
1. A Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M
2. Csv file that has the geographical coordinates of each postal code:
http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data
3.FourSquare API to collect data about locations of gyms in the city of Toronto. 
https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore?&client_id={}&client_secret={}&v={}&ll={},{}&radius={}&limit={}

## METHODOLOGY
First I will scrape Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas  dataframe.
My main target here is to asses which city would have the highest Pizza store density. 
I used the Four Square API through the venues channel. I used the near query to get venues in the cities. 
Also, I use the CategoryID to set it to show only Pizza Places. An Example of my requests:

https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore?&client_id=&client_secret=&v=20180605&New York, NY&limit=100&categoryId=4bf58dd8d48988d1ca941735

That 4bf58dd8d48988d1ca941735 is the Id of the Pizza Place Category. Also, Foursquare limits us to maximum of 100 venues per query.

Moreover, I repeated this request for the 5 studied cities and got their top 100 venues.
I saved the name and coordinate data only from the result and plotted them on the map for visual inspection.

Next, to get an indicator of the density of Pizza Places, I calculated 
a center coordinate of the venues to get the mean longitude and latitude values. Then I calculated the mean of the Euclidean distance from each venue to the mean coordinates. That was my indicator; mean distance to the mean coordinate.
Results

For our initial visual inspection we see that they all have multiple pizza 
places and often more than Foursquare would like to supply us. The following here are the pictures of the geoplot generated with folium:
